The following jupyter notebooks have been adaped from the carpentried material [Introduction to Geospatial Raster and Vector Data with Python](https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/geospatial-python/)

Episoids 5-8 have been covered:
* 5 Access satellite imagery using Python
* 6 Read and visualize raster data
* 7 Vector data in Python
* 8 Crop raster data with rioxarray and geopandas

Each with a working and complete notebook for use in workshop instruction.

Note: The [Data sets](https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/geospatial-python/index.html#data-sets) and [Software Setup](https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/geospatial-python/index.html#software-setup) are required.
